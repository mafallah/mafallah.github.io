I am an Assistant Professor of Finance in the [Department of Finance, Real Estate and Business Law](https://craig.fresnostate.edu/fbl/index.html) at [California State University, Fresno](https://www.fresnostate.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Finance from the [University of Texas at San Antonio](https://business.utsa.edu/finance/). My research interests include empirical corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, investments, private equity, and behavioral finance. 

I hold a Master of Science degree in Finance from the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.edu/) in Chicago, IL. Prior to joining the PhD program at UTSA, I worked as an investment analyst. I am also a [CFA](https://www.cfainstitute.org/) level III candidate.

I am passionate about teaching finance and enjoy interacting with students. I have taught courses at undergraduate and graduate levels, both in online and in-person formats. I am a proud co-advisor of the Student-Managed Investment Fund [SMIF] (https://smifclub369.com/).
